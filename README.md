# Delphi ventilator control interface 

The Delphi interface is an extensible control interface board design and specification for use in opensource ventilator designs.

## Design concept

We believe that the global engineering and design community needs to modularize our efforts as we seek to develop a safe opensource ventilator which healthcare providers can use to address equipment shortages during the coronavirus pandemic. Our contribution to this ecosystem is an extensible and standardized user control interface which can be utilized in other ventilator design projects. 

The Delphi control interface is system-agnostic, compatible with a wide range of potential ventilator designs, sensor configurations, and component models. Our team's efforts are concentrated on:

    1. Developing overview documentation, hardware schematics, software, and relevant specifications to faciliate the use of the Delphi interface in existing ventilator design projects.
    
    2. Continuing user testing of the interface with clinicians and revising the Delphi design accordingly.

## Other ventilator module projects

[Ventmon](https://github.com/PubInv/ventmon-ventilator-inline-test-monitor) is a combined tester/monitor that would help clinicians validate untrusted ventilators in the case of a shortfall of commercial and professional equipment. @PubInv is a fellow advocate of a modularized ecosystem model and is supporting the coordination of community efforts around benchmarking and breath analysis standards.
